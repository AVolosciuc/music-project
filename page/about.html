          <p class="card-text">Rock music, sometimes also known as "rock and roll," is a style of music that became 
              popular in the 1950s in America and Europe. It is primarily based on older musical styles, such as the
              rhythm and blues music originated by African American performers such as Chuck Berry and Little Richard,
                with a heavy focus on guitar, drums, and powerful vocals.

              One of the earliest and most famous performers in the early days of rock was Elvis Presley, who shocked 
              the world with his suggestive dancing and powerful music. He became an instant phenomenon, and led the way 
              for many other performers over the decades to come. In the 1960s, the Beatles were another hugely successful 
              and popular rock music group, also inspired by rhythm and blues songs and by the work of other early British
              rock performers, such as Cliff Richard.

              Over the years, rock music has branched out into a wide variety of styles. Folk rock, such as that made 
              popular by Bob Dylan in the 1960s, often featured acoustic guitars and socially conscious lyrics, many 
              with anti-war sentiments. Psychedelic rock, such as that played by the Grateful Dead, Pink Floyd, and the
              Doors, featured often dissonant music that was heavily influenced by the use of drugs such as LSD. 
              Progressive rock bands, such as the Moody Blues, Rush, and Yes, experimented with a wide range of instruments,
              and often included improvisational musical solos that could last for 10 or even 20 minutes.

              Rock has also led the way for other music forms, such as heavy metal, which features extreme guitar sound 
              and heavy distortion. Some of the earliest bands that could be classified as heavy metal are Led Zeppelin 
              and Black Sabbath. Both bands started out in the mid-1970s. Their heavy form of music has paved the way for
              other heavy metal bands, including Metallica and Megadeth.

              Today, the term "rock music" is used to refer to a wide range of musical forms, including anything from soft
              pop to heavy metal. The name has essentially become a default term for any style of music that does not 
              automatically fit into another category, such as R&B, country, or classical. The form has changed 
              significantly since the days of Elvis Presley, but the term can still refer to his songs as easily as they 
              can refer to more recent bands like Nirvana or Pearl Jam.</p>
