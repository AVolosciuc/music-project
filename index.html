            <h6 class="title">Nirvana</h6>
            <p class="card-text">Nirvana was an American rock band formed in Aberdeen, 
              Washington in 1987. Founded by lead singer and guitarist Kurt Cobain and bassist 
              Krist Novoselic, the band went through a succession of drummers, most notably Chad Channing,
              before recruiting Dave Grohl in 1990. Nirvana's success popularized alternative rock,
              and they were often referenced as the figurehead band of Generation X. Their music maintains 
              a popular following and continues to influence modern rock culture.</p>

            <p class="card-text">Three Days Grace is a hard rock band from Canada who has had great success 
            on the charts thanks to a series of high-impact singles that merge melodic vocals with snarling guitars. 
            Though loosely classified as alt-metal because of their songsâ€™ menacing atmosphere, Three Days Grace 
            have more accurately positioned themselves as radio-ready rockers with an edge often lacking in their 
            polished peers.</p>

            <h6 class="title">AC/DC</h6>
            <p class="card-text">AC/DC were formed in 1973 in Australia by guitarist Malcolm Young after his previous 
              band, the Velvet Underground, collapsed (no relation to the seminal American group). With his younger 
              brother Angus serving as lead guitarist, the band played some gigs around Sydney. Angus was only 18 at 
              the time, and his sister suggested that he wear his school uniform on-stage; the look became the band's
              visual trademark. While still in Sydney, the original lineup featuring singer Dave Evans cut a single 
              called "Can I Sit Next to You," with ex-Easybeats Harry Vanda and George Young (Malcolm and Angus' older
              brother) producing.</p>

            <h6 class="title">Evanescence</h6>
            <p class="card-text">Evanescence was formed in the early '90s by Amy Lee and founding member Ben Moody 
              at a youth camp in their native Little Rock, Arkansas. Lee and Moody worked steadily together, releasing
              three EPs at the tail-end of the '90s, followed by a full-length album called Origin. They signed with 
               Wind-Up Records in 2002, expanding to a full lineup consisting of guitarist John LeCompt, bassist
              Will Boyd, and drummer Rocky Gray not long after the completion of the band's major-label debut, Fallen. 
              Released in the spring of 2003 and initially marketed toward CCM audiences -- an association the band
              disavowed rather rapidly -- Fallen quickly proved to be a success thanks to the platinum hit single 
              "Bring Me to Life," which was soon followed by "My Immortal," both reaching the Billboard Top Ten 
              in the U.S. The album eventually went 17-times platinum across the globe. All this success led to two
              Grammys, one for Best New Artist and one for Best Hard Rock Performance, but a split within the ranks 
              soon emerged, with Ben Moody leaving the group during their European tour.</p>

            <h6 class="title">Metallica</h6>
            <p class="card-text">Metallica is one of the most important and most influential metal bands of all time, 
              drafting the blueprint for thrash metal in their earliest days, then pushing the boundaries of mainstream
               metal and hard rock as they settled into their role as a popular legacy act as the decades went on. 
               Between the meeting of raw energy and intricate speed metal compositions of their 1983 debut Kill 
               'Em All and the layered, radio-geared production of 1991's self-titled "black album," the band turned in 
               classic album after classic album, each new chapter leading the development of metal on a global scale. 
               Throughout the '90s and beyond, the group was highly active as a stadium-level touring act while 
               sporadically releasing new music. Razor-sharp riffs, growling vocals, and high-power precision drumming 
               remained at the core of their sound even as they explored new ideas on later albums like 2003's 
               St. Anger or their tenth studio album, 2016's Hardwired...To Self-Destruct.</p>
